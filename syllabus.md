Week 1: Scalability & Performance Optimization
We’ll break down the topics into 7 days to move from basic to advanced concepts.

📅 Day 1: Understanding Scalability
What is Scalability?
Scalability is the ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources. It ensures that performance remains stable as traffic grows.
Types of Scalability:
Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)
Adding more resources (CPU, RAM, Storage) to a single server.
Limited by hardware capacity.
Example: Upgrading a server from 8GB RAM to 32GB.
Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)
Adding more machines (servers) to handle traffic.
Load is distributed across multiple instances.
Example: Deploying multiple instances behind a load balancer.
When to Use?
Vertical Scaling is easier but expensive and has a limit.
Horizontal Scaling is more flexible but requires extra infrastructure (load balancers, distributed databases).
🔍 Activity:
Research how companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Google scale their applications.

📅 Day 2: API Gateway & Its Role in Scalability
What is an API Gateway?
An API Gateway is a single entry point for client requests. It acts as a reverse proxy and handles routing, authentication, and rate limiting.
Why Use an API Gateway?
✅ Manages multiple microservices efficiently.
 ✅ Improves security with authentication & rate limiting.
 ✅ Reduces API call overhead by aggregating responses.
Popular API Gateways:
Kong API Gateway
AWS API Gateway
NGINX as API Gateway
🔍 Activity:
Install Kong API Gateway locally and set up a simple API.

📅 Day 3: Load Balancing - Distributing Traffic Efficiently
What is Load Balancing?
Load balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload.
Types of Load Balancers:
DNS Load Balancing (Traffic is distributed at the DNS level)
Software Load Balancers (NGINX, HAProxy)
Hardware Load Balancers (F5, Citrix NetScaler)
Load Balancing Algorithms:
Round Robin → Requests are evenly distributed.
Least Connections → Sends requests to the server with the fewest connections.
IP Hashing → Routes requests from the same client to the same server.
🔍 Activity:
Set up an NGINX Load Balancer and route traffic to multiple Node.js servers.

📅 Day 4: Caching - Making Apps Faster
What is Caching?
Caching stores frequently accessed data to reduce database queries and improve performance.
Types of Caching:
CDN Caching → Stores static assets closer to users (Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront).
Application Caching → Stores computed results (Redis, Memcached).
Database Caching → Caches query results for faster retrieval.
Cache Invalidation Strategies:
Time-based Expiration (TTL - Time to Live).
Write-through Cache (Data is updated in cache and DB).
Lazy Loading (Cache updates only when data is requested).
🔍 Activity:
Install Redis and set up caching for a simple Node.js API.

📅 Day 5: CAP Theorem & PACELC Theorem
What is the CAP Theorem?
It states that a distributed system cannot guarantee all three at the same time:
Consistency (C) → All nodes see the same data at the same time.
Availability (A) → Every request gets a response.
Partition Tolerance (P) → System works despite network failures.
⚡ Tradeoff: In reality, systems pick CP (Strong Consistency) or AP (High Availability).
PACELC Theorem
Extends CAP by adding a trade-off in the absence of network failure:
If partitioned (P) → Choose A or C.
Else (E) → Choose Latency (L) or Consistency (C).
🔍 Activity:
Study how MongoDB (AP) and PostgreSQL (CP) follow CAP.

📅 Day 6: Bloom Filters - Efficient Lookups
What is a Bloom Filter?
A probabilistic data structure used to check if an item may be present in a dataset (false positives possible).
How it Works?
Insert an item → Hash it to multiple positions in a bit array.
Lookup → Check those positions; if all bits are 1, the item may exist.
🚀 Use Cases:
Caching (Avoid unnecessary DB lookups).
Spell checkers.
Preventing duplicate registrations.
🔍 Activity:
Implement a Bloom Filter in JavaScript.

📅 Day 7: Hands-on Project - Putting It All Together
Project: Build a Scalable API Service
✅ Use NGINX for load balancing.
 ✅ Implement caching using Redis.
 ✅ Design an API Gateway using Kong.
 ✅ Optimize API responses using Bloom Filters.
🔍 Activity:

Week 2: Databases & Data Storage
This week, we will explore SQL & NoSQL databases, data modeling, indexing, partitioning, sharding, and replication with hands-on implementation.

📅 Day 1: SQL vs. NoSQL - Understanding the Database Landscape
What is a Database?
A database is a structured system for storing, retrieving, and managing data efficiently.
Types of Databases:
SQL Databases (Relational Databases)


Structured data stored in tables.
Uses SQL for queries (SELECT, JOIN, etc.).
ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB.
NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational)


Designed for flexible and high-performance applications.
Supports unstructured or semi-structured data.
BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent).
Examples: MongoDB (Document-based), Redis (Key-Value), Cassandra (Wide-Column), Neo4j (Graph-based).
When to Use What?

Create a sample table in PostgreSQL and a document in MongoDB.

📅 Day 2: Data Modeling & Normalization
What is Data Modeling?
Data modeling defines the structure, relationships, and rules for storing and retrieving data efficiently.
Data Modeling in SQL:
1NF (First Normal Form): No duplicate columns.
2NF (Second Normal Form): No partial dependencies.
3NF (Third Normal Form): No transitive dependencies.
BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form): Stronger version of 3NF.
Example: E-commerce Database
Users (id, name, email, address)
Orders (id, user_id, product_id, quantity, status)
Products (id, name, price)
Data Modeling in NoSQL:
Denormalization is preferred for fast reads.
Schema is flexible (JSON, Key-Value, Graph).
Example: A User Profile document in MongoDB:
 {
  "_id": "123",
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "orders": [
    {"product": "Laptop", "price": 1200},
    {"product": "Mouse", "price": 50}
  ]
}


🔍 Activity:
Design a normalized database for an online bookstore in PostgreSQL.
Create a NoSQL schema for a messaging app in MongoDB.

📅 Day 3: Indexing Strategies - Optimizing Query Performance
What is Indexing?
An index is a data structure that speeds up search queries.
Types of Indexes:
B-Tree Index (Balanced Tree)


Default in PostgreSQL, MySQL.
Optimized for range queries.
Hash Index


Used for exact matches.
Faster than B-Tree but not for range queries.
GIN (Generalized Inverted Index)


Used for full-text search.
Creating an Index in PostgreSQL:
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);

🔍 Activity:
Run an EXPLAIN ANALYZE query in PostgreSQL before and after indexing.
Implement a MongoDB index on a user collection.

📅 Day 4: Partitioning - Handling Large Datasets
What is Partitioning?
Partitioning divides a large table into smaller, more manageable pieces.
Types of Partitioning:
Range Partitioning: Based on value ranges (e.g., Date).
Hash Partitioning: Even distribution based on a hash function.
List Partitioning: Based on predefined categories.
Composite Partitioning: Combination of two or more partitioning types.
Partitioning in PostgreSQL:
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    total_price NUMERIC,
    created_at DATE
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

🔍 Activity:
Partition a sales table based on year in PostgreSQL.
Implement range-based partitioning in MongoDB.

📅 Day 5: Sharding - Distributing Data Across Nodes
What is Sharding?
Sharding splits large databases across multiple machines to improve scalability.
Types of Sharding:
Key-based Sharding: Uses a hash function (e.g., User ID % number of shards).
Range-based Sharding: Divides based on range (e.g., A-M goes to Shard 1, N-Z to Shard 2).
Directory-based Sharding: A lookup service maps data to shards.
Sharding in MongoDB:
sh.enableSharding("myDatabase");
sh.shardCollection("myDatabase.users", { "_id": "hashed" });

🔍 Activity:

📅 Day 6: Replication - Ensuring High Availability
What is Replication?
Replication keeps multiple copies of a database across different servers.
Types of Replication:
Leader-Follower (Master-Slave) → Leader handles writes, followers handle reads.
Multi-Leader (Master-Master) → Multiple leaders for writes.
Peer-to-Peer (No Master) → All nodes are equal.
Replication in PostgreSQL:
SELECT pg_create_physical_replication_slot('replica_slot');

Week 3: Networking & Communication
This week, you'll dive into networking fundamentals, REST API design, gRPC, GraphQL, WebSockets, and proxies, progressing from basic concepts to hands-on implementations.

📅 Day 1: Basics of Computer Networking
What is Networking?
Networking is the process of connecting computers, servers, and devices to share data efficiently.
Key Concepts:
IP Addresses & Ports


IPv4 vs. IPv6
Ports (e.g., HTTP - 80, HTTPS - 443, MySQL - 3306)
TCP vs. UDP


TCP: Reliable, ordered, slower (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS).
UDP: Fast, connectionless (e.g., video streaming, gaming).
HTTP vs. HTTPS


HTTP: Unencrypted, insecure.
HTTPS: Secure (SSL/TLS).
DNS (Domain Name System)


Resolves domain names to IP addresses (e.g., google.com → 172.217.160.142).
🔍 Activity:
Run ping google.com and traceroute google.com to see network paths.
Test TCP vs. UDP by sending data with Netcat (nc).

📅 Day 2: REST API Principles
What is REST?
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an API design pattern that follows:
 ✅ Statelessness (No session state stored on the server).
 ✅ Client-Server Separation.
 ✅ Resource-Based URLs (e.g., /users/{id}).
RESTful API Methods:
HTTP Method
Action
Example Endpoint
GET
Read Data
/users/1
POST
Create Data
/users
PUT
Update Data
/users/1
DELETE
Remove Data
/users/1

Example: Building a REST API in Node.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ id: req.params.id, name: "John Doe" });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));

🔍 Activity:
Test REST APIs using Postman or curl.
Create CRUD APIs for a To-Do App using Express.js.

📅 Day 3: gRPC and Protocol Buffers
What is gRPC?
gRPC is a high-performance, language-independent Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework developed by Google.
 🚀 Faster than REST due to Protocol Buffers (protobufs) instead of JSON.
Key Features:
✔️ Binary data format (protobuf) → Smaller, faster.
 ✔️ Strongly-typed contracts → API schema enforced.
 ✔️ Bidirectional streaming → Efficient real-time communication.
Example: Define a gRPC Service (user.proto)
syntax = "proto3";

service UserService {
  rpc GetUser (UserRequest) returns (UserResponse);
}

message UserRequest {
  string id = 1;
}

message UserResponse {
  string id = 1;
  string name = 2;
}

Run gRPC Server in Node.js
const grpc = require('@grpc/grpc-js');
const protoLoader = require('@grpc/proto-loader');

const packageDefinition = protoLoader.loadSync('user.proto');
const userProto = grpc.loadPackageDefinition(packageDefinition).UserService;

const server = new grpc.Server();
server.addService(userProto.service, {
  GetUser: (call, callback) => {
    callback(null, { id: call.request.id, name: "Alice" });
  }
});

server.bindAsync('0.0.0.0:50051', grpc.ServerCredentials.createInsecure(), () => {
  server.start();
});

🔍 Activity:
Implement a gRPC microservice for user management.
Compare REST vs. gRPC performance using Postman & BloomRPC.

📅 Day 4: GraphQL - Schema Design, Queries, Mutations
What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need.
Key Benefits:
✔️ Single Endpoint (/graphql) – No multiple REST routes.
 ✔️ Strongly Typed Schema – Defines API contract.
 ✔️ No Over-fetching – Fetch only required fields.
GraphQL Schema Example (User Type)
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}

type Query {
  getUser(id: ID!): User
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(name: String!, email: String!): User
}

Building a GraphQL API in Node.js
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');

const typeDefs = gql`
  type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    email: String!
  }
  type Query {
    getUser(id: ID!): User
  }
  type Mutation {
    createUser(name: String!, email: String!): User
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    getUser: (_, { id }) => ({ id, name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com" }),
  },
  Mutation: {
    createUser: (_, { name, email }) => ({ id: "1", name, email }),
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
server.listen(4000, () => console.log('GraphQL Server running on 4000'));

🔍 Activity:
Test GraphQL queries in Apollo Sandbox.
Convert a REST API into GraphQL.

📅 Day 5: DNS & Proxies
What is DNS?
DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names into IP addresses.
Types of Proxies:
Forward Proxy – Acts on behalf of the client (e.g., VPNs).
Reverse Proxy – Sits in front of the server (e.g., Nginx, Cloudflare).
Setting Up Nginx as a Reverse Proxy
server {
    listen 80;
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000/;
    }
}

🔍 Activity:
Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for a Node.js server.
Use dig or nslookup to analyze DNS resolution.

📅 Day 6: WebSockets & Long Polling
What is WebSockets?
WebSockets allow bidirectional communication between client and server.
 🚀 Used in chat apps, real-time notifications, stock trading apps.
WebSockets in Node.js
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', ws => {
  ws.send('Welcome to WebSocket Server!');
  ws.on('message', message => console.log(`Received: ${message}`));
});

🔍 Activity:
Implement a real-time chat app using WebSockets.
Compare WebSockets vs. Long Polling performance.

📅 Day 7: Final Project - Real-World API Architecture

Week 4: Distributed Systems & Fault Tolerance
This week, you'll explore distributed computing, consistency models, replication strategies, and fault tolerance techniques from basic concepts to hands-on implementations.

📅 Day 1: Basics of Distributed Systems
What is a Distributed System?
A distributed system is a collection of computers working together as a single unit.
 🚀 Examples: Google Search, Netflix, Kubernetes clusters.
Challenges in Distributed Systems:
Latency & Network Failures – Communication delays and node failures.
Consistency & Availability Trade-offs – CAP Theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance).
Concurrency & Synchronization – Handling multiple requests efficiently.
Types of Distributed Architectures:
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) – Equal nodes (e.g., BitTorrent).
Client-Server – Centralized servers handle clients (e.g., Web apps).
Microservices – Independent services communicate via APIs (e.g., Netflix).
🔍 Activity:
Read about Google’s Spanner & Amazon DynamoDB distributed systems.
Set up a basic multi-node cluster using Docker Swarm.

📅 Day 2: Consistency Models (Strong, Eventual, Causal)
Why is Consistency Important?
Consistency ensures that all nodes in a distributed system have the same view of data.
Types of Consistency Models:
Consistency Model
Description
Example
Strong Consistency
All nodes see the latest data immediately.
Traditional SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
Eventual Consistency
Nodes may have stale data but will eventually be up-to-date.
NoSQL databases (DynamoDB, Cassandra)
Causal Consistency
Ensures cause-effect relationships in data updates.
Google Docs, collaborative editing apps

🔍 Activity:
Simulate eventual consistency with MongoDB Replication.
Experiment with strong consistency using PostgreSQL transactions.

📅 Day 3: Quorum Mechanism
What is Quorum?
A quorum ensures a minimum number of nodes agree before an operation is confirmed.
 📌 Used in distributed databases (Raft, Paxos, Cassandra).
How Quorum Works in a Distributed Database:
Read Quorum (R) – Minimum nodes required to read data.
Write Quorum (W) – Minimum nodes required to confirm a write.
Total Nodes (N) → Typically, R + W > N ensures consistency.
Example: In Cassandra, setting R=2, W=2, N=3 ensures strong consistency.
🔍 Activity:
Simulate quorum-based reads & writes in Cassandra.
Experiment with ZooKeeper quorum mechanisms.

📅 Day 4: Leader-Follower Architecture
What is Leader-Follower Replication?
🚀 Leader-Follower (Master-Slave) replication is a model where one node (Leader) writes data, while others (Followers) replicate it.
How It Works:
1️⃣ Leader handles all writes → Ensures strong consistency.
 2️⃣ Followers replicate data asynchronously.
 3️⃣ Failover: If the leader fails, a new leader is elected.
Example: PostgreSQL Leader-Follower Setup
1️⃣ Set up the Leader node
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = 'replica';
SELECT pg_start_backup('backup');

2️⃣ Configure the Follower node
cp -r data/* replica_data/
echo "standby_mode = 'on'" >> replica_data/postgresql.conf

3️⃣ Start the Follower instance
pg_ctl start -D replica_data

🔍 Activity:
Implement leader-follower replication in PostgreSQL.
Use Redis Sentinel for automatic failover in Redis clusters.

📅 Day 5: Merkle Trees & Data Integrity
What is a Merkle Tree?
A Merkle Tree is a tree structure where each node stores a hash of its child nodes.
 📌 Used in Git, Bitcoin, Cassandra to verify data integrity efficiently.
How It Works:
Leaf Nodes → Store data hashes.
Parent Nodes → Store combined hashes of child nodes.
Root Hash → Unique fingerprint of all data.
Example: Verifying blockchain transactions with Merkle Trees
const crypto = require('crypto');
function hash(data) { return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(data).digest('hex'); }

let transactions = ["tx1", "tx2", "tx3", "tx4"].map(hash);
let parent = hash(transactions[0] + transactions[1]);
console.log("Merkle Root Hash:", parent);

🔍 Activity:
Implement a Merkle Tree hash function in Python or JavaScript.
Explore how Bitcoin uses Merkle Trees for transaction validation.

📅 Day 6: Consistent Hashing
What is Consistent Hashing?
Consistent hashing is a load-balancing technique that minimizes reallocation of data when servers are added or removed.
 📌 Used in DynamoDB, Memcached, Distributed Caching Systems.
How It Works:
1️⃣ Each server is assigned a range on a circular hash ring.
 2️⃣ Keys are mapped to a server using a hash function.
 3️⃣ When a server fails or is added, only a fraction of keys are remapped instead of all.
Example: Hashing a Key to a Server
const crypto = require('crypto');
const servers = ["Server-1", "Server-2", "Server-3"];
function hashKey(key) {
  return crypto.createHash('md5').update(key).digest('hex');
}
console.log("Assigned Server:", servers[parseInt(hashKey("user123"), 16) % servers.length]);

🔍 Activity:
Implement consistent hashing in a distributed caching system (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
Analyze how Amazon DynamoDB uses consistent hashing.

📅 Day 7: Final Project - Distributed System Simulation
✅ Build a leader-follower PostgreSQL database cluster.
 ✅ Implement a distributed cache using consistent hashing (Redis).
 ✅ Use Merkle Trees for efficient data integrity verification.
 ✅ Simulate quorum-based decision-making in Cassandra.
🚀 Congratulations! You've completed Distributed Systems & Fault Tolerance!
 📌 Next: Move to Week 5 - Scalability & Performance Optimization!

Week 5️⃣ - APIs & Architectural Design Patterns
This week, you'll dive deep into API design, explore architectural patterns, and implement scalable system designs from basic concepts to hands-on applications.

📅 Day 1: API Design Best Practices
What Makes a Good API?
A well-designed API is:
 ✅ Consistent → Follows predictable naming conventions.
 ✅ Versioned → Allows backward compatibility.
 ✅ Secure → Implements authentication & rate limiting.
 ✅ Efficient → Uses proper status codes and pagination.
RESTful API Design Guidelines:
1️⃣ Use nouns in URIs → /users, /orders/{id} ✅ (Avoid verbs like /getUser).
 2️⃣ Use HTTP status codes:
200 OK → Success
201 Created → Resource created
400 Bad Request → Invalid input
404 Not Found → Resource missing
 3️⃣ Version your API: /api/v1/users
Activity:
🔹 Build a REST API in Node.js with Express
 🔹 Apply API versioning & proper status codes

📅 Day 2: Monolith vs. Microservices Architecture
Monolithic Architecture
🟢 Pros:
 ✔ Simple to develop & deploy
 ✔ Single codebase & shared memory
🔴 Cons:
 ❌ Hard to scale
 ❌ A single failure can crash the entire system
Microservices Architecture
🟢 Pros:
 ✔ Independent deployment & scaling
 ✔ Easier fault isolation
🔴 Cons:
 ❌ More complex communication
 ❌ Requires service discovery & orchestration
Activity:
🔹 Convert a monolithic Node.js app into microservices using Express & Docker.
 🔹 Implement inter-service communication with REST or gRPC.

📅 Day 3: Event-Driven Architecture (Pub/Sub, Message Queues)
What is Event-Driven Architecture?
Event-driven systems react to changes asynchronously.
 📌 Used in real-time systems (Uber, Netflix, Slack).
Key Patterns:
1️⃣ Pub/Sub Model – A publisher sends events to multiple subscribers.
 2️⃣ Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) – Messages are sent to a queue and processed later.
Example: Kafka Pub/Sub in Node.js
const kafka = require('kafka-node');
const producer = new kafka.Producer(new kafka.KafkaClient());
producer.send([{ topic: 'order_created', messages: 'New order placed!' }], () => {});

Activity:
🔹 Set up a Pub/Sub model using Redis or Kafka.
 🔹 Implement event-driven order processing.

📅 Day 4: Sharding Pattern
What is Sharding?
Sharding splits data across multiple databases to improve performance & scalability.
 📌 Used by Facebook, Instagram, YouTube for large-scale systems.
Types of Sharding:
Type
How It Works
Example
Key-Based
Uses a hash function to distribute data.
User IDs in a distributed database.
Range-Based
Divides data into ranges.
Orders from 2020–2022 in DB1, 2023 in DB2.
Directory-Based
Stores a lookup table for shard locations.
Managing large-scale file storage.

Activity:
🔹 Implement MongoDB sharding in a Node.js app.
 🔹 Analyze PostgreSQL partitioning strategies.

📅 Day 5: Circuit Breaker Pattern
What is Circuit Breaking?
A circuit breaker prevents a system from making repeated failed requests to an unhealthy service.
 📌 Used in Netflix, Amazon, and distributed microservices.
States of a Circuit Breaker:
1️⃣ Closed – Requests are sent normally.
 2️⃣ Open – Requests are blocked after repeated failures.
 3️⃣ Half-Open – A few test requests check if the system recovers.
Implementing a Circuit Breaker in Node.js with Opossum:
const CircuitBreaker = require('opossum');
const slowAPI = () => fetch('https://example.com/api');

const breaker = new CircuitBreaker(slowAPI, { timeout: 5000, errorThresholdPercentage: 50 });
breaker.fallback(() => "Service unavailable, try later.");

breaker.fire().then(console.log).catch(console.error);

Activity:
🔹 Implement a circuit breaker for a microservice using Opossum.
 🔹 Simulate a failing API and analyze recovery behavior.

📅 Day 6: Static Content Hosting
What is Static Content?
Static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images) don’t change dynamically and can be cached for performance.
Hosting Options:
1️⃣ CDN (Cloudflare, AWS S3, Netlify, Vercel) – Best for speed & scalability.
 2️⃣ Nginx/Apache – Serve static files from a traditional web server.
 3️⃣ Node.js & Express – Serve files with express.static().
Example: Serving Static Files in Express.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.static('public'));
app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));

Activity:
🔹 Deploy a React app on Vercel or Netlify.
 🔹 Optimize images & cache static assets with Nginx.
