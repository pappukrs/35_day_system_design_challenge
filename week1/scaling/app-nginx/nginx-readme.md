Let's break this **NGINX configuration** down step by step so that you can understand each part clearly.  

---

### **🔹 `events { }` Block**
```nginx
events { }
```
- This is a required section in NGINX but is **not important for basic load balancing**.
- It contains settings related to connection handling, but since we don't modify anything here, it's left empty.

---

### **🔹 `http {}` Block**
This block is where all HTTP-related configurations are placed.

#### **1️⃣ Define a Load Balancing Group (upstream)**
```nginx
upstream node_servers {
    server node-app-1:4000;
    server node-app-2:4001;
    server node-app-3:4002;
}
```
- **What is `upstream`?**  
  - It is a name (`node_servers`) given to a group of backend servers.
  - NGINX will distribute traffic between the defined servers.
- **Servers inside `upstream`**  
  - `server node-app-1:4000;` → A Node.js instance running on `node-app-1` at port `4000`
  - `server node-app-2:4001;` → Another instance on port `4001`
  - `server node-app-3:4002;` → Another instance on port `4002`

💡 **These names (`node-app-1`, `node-app-2`, etc.) are Docker container names** if you're using **Docker Compose**.

---

#### **2️⃣ Configure the Reverse Proxy Server**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://node_servers;
    }
}
```
- **`server {}`** → Defines an NGINX virtual server.
- **`listen 80;`** → Listens on port **80** (default HTTP port).
- **`location / {}`** → Handles all requests (`/` means all paths).
- **`proxy_pass http://node_servers;`** → Forwards requests to the `node_servers` group (load balances between `4000`, `4001`, and `4002`).

---

### **🔹 How Load Balancing Works**
1. A client sends a request to `http://localhost/` (NGINX on port **80**).
2. NGINX selects one of the Node.js servers (`4000`, `4001`, or `4002`) using **round-robin** by default.
3. The request is forwarded to the selected backend, and the response is returned to the client.

---

### **🔹 How Does This Work with Docker?**
If you are using **Docker Compose**, the `node-app-1`, `node-app-2`, and `node-app-3` are **container names** instead of `127.0.0.1`.  
This means your `docker-compose.yml` might have services like:
```yaml
services:
  node-app-1:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"

  node-app-2:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "4001:4000"

  node-app-3:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "4002:4000"

  nginx:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
    depends_on:
      - node-app-1
      - node-app-2
      - node-app-3
```
In this case:
- The `server node-app-1:4000;` means "send traffic to the **container named `node-app-1`** on port `4000`."
- NGINX can communicate with containers **inside the same Docker network** without using `127.0.0.1`.

---

### **🔹 Summary**
✅ **NGINX Load Balancer**
- **Distributes requests across multiple Node.js instances.**
- **Uses Docker container names** instead of `127.0.0.1` if running in Docker.
- **Improves performance & reliability** by preventing a single server from being overloaded.
