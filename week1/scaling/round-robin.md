### **⚡ Understanding Load Balancing & Round Robin (Basic to Advanced) 🚀**  

Load balancing is a method to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to **prevent overloading** and **ensure high availability**.  
**Round Robin** is the most commonly used load-balancing algorithm.

---

## **📌 Basic Concept: What is Round Robin?**
Round Robin is a simple way to distribute incoming requests **evenly** across multiple servers in a sequential order.

#### **Example Scenario:**
Imagine you have **3 servers** (S1, S2, S3), and **6 requests** (R1 to R6) come in.

🔄 **Round Robin assigns requests like this:**  
- **R1 → S1**  
- **R2 → S2**  
- **R3 → S3**  
- **R4 → S1** (cycle repeats)  
- **R5 → S2**  
- **R6 → S3**  

Every server gets **equal workload**, which helps prevent overloading one server.

## **📌 Where is Round Robin Used in Scaling?**
Round Robin is commonly used in:
✅ **Nginx Load Balancer**  
✅ **Kubernetes Service Load Balancer**  
✅ **AWS Elastic Load Balancer**  
✅ **PM2 Cluster Mode**  
✅ **DNS Load Balancing**

## **📌 Types of Round Robin Load Balancing**
1️⃣ **Simple Round Robin** 🌀  
- Requests are assigned **strictly in order**, no matter the server’s current load.  
- **Good for equal-capacity servers**.  
- Example: If **S1 is overloaded**, it still gets new requests.  

2️⃣ **Weighted Round Robin** ⚖️  
- Assigns **more requests** to **powerful servers** based on weight.  
- Example: If **S1 has a stronger CPU**, it gets **more traffic**.  
- Example configuration in Nginx:
  ```nginx
  upstream my_servers {
      server server1.com weight=3;  # S1 gets 3x more requests
      server server2.com weight=1;
  }
  ```

3️⃣ **Least Connections (Alternative to Round Robin)** 🚀  
- New requests go to the **server with the fewest active connections**.  
- **Better for dynamic workloads**.  
- Used in **Nginx, AWS ELB, Kubernetes Load Balancer**.  

4️⃣ **IP Hashing** 🔑  
- Requests from the **same user IP** always go to the **same server**.  
- Used in **sticky sessions** (like user login-based apps).  
- Example: If a user logs in on **S2**, their next request also goes to **S2**.

---

## **📌 Advanced Understanding: When is Round Robin Not the Best?**
❌ **Not good for varying load**  
   - If requests have different processing times, some servers might get overloaded.  
   - Example: If **S1 is slow**, it still gets requests.  

❌ **Not good for stateful applications**  
   - Example: If a user logs in on **S1**, but their next request goes to **S2**, the session might break.  
   - **Solution:** Use **sticky sessions (IP Hashing)** or a **shared session store (Redis, Database)**.

## **📌 Example: Implementing Round Robin Load Balancing**
### **🔹 Nginx Load Balancer (Simple Round Robin)**
**`nginx.conf`**
```nginx
http {
    upstream backend_servers {
        server server1.com;
        server server2.com;
        server server3.com;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend_servers;
        }
    }
}
```
- This will send requests **evenly** to `server1.com`, `server2.com`, and `server3.com`.

---

### **🔹 Kubernetes Load Balancer (Round Robin by Default)**
**`service.yaml`**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: node-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: node-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
```
- Kubernetes automatically uses **Round Robin**.

---

### **🔹 PM2 Load Balancing (Round Robin by Default)**
```sh
pm2 start server.js -i max
```
- This runs the app on **all available CPU cores** and distributes requests **round robin**.

---

## **📌 Which Load Balancing Strategy Should You Use?**
| Scenario | Best Strategy |
|----------|--------------|
| **Equal load servers** | Round Robin ✅ |
| **Unequal server power** | Weighted Round Robin ⚖️ |
| **Dynamic request load** | Least Connections 🔄 |
| **User sessions (logins)** | IP Hashing 🔑 |
